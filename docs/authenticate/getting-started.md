# Getting Started

Option 1: Read, ask questions, and improve the docs! :-)

Option 2: Dive right into configuration files in
the [conf](https://github.com/greenpau/caddy-auth-docs/blob/main/assets/conf/)

Additionally, please see issues tagged [config example](https://github.com/greenpau/caddy-security/issues?q=label%3A%22config+example%22+).

Further, [search](https://github.com/search?l=Dockerfile&q=greenpau%2Fcaddy-security&type=Code)
GitHub for the Dockerfile files referencing `caddy-security`. Then, see how others use it.
